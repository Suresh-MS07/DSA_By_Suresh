# 🏆 LeetCode Problem 169: Majority Element

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

---

## 🔹 Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n`. Your task is to find the **majority element** in the array.

> The **majority element** is the element that appears **more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times**.  
> You may assume that the majority element **always exists** in the array.

## 🔹 Examples

**Example 1**
```text
Input: nums = [3, 2, 3]
Output: 3
 
Input: nums = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Output: 2

🔹 Constraints

n == nums.length

1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4

-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

🔹 Follow-up

Can you solve this problem in linear time O(n) and constant space O(1)?

Hint: Think about algorithms that track a candidate element efficiently.

🔹 Key Points

The majority element always exists, so no need to handle "no solution" cases.

The problem tests your understanding of arrays, counting techniques, and optimization.

Ideal for interview preparation and competitive programming practice.
